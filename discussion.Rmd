The data set turned out to be difficult to work with due to some data fields being empty and a large portion of the fully-usable columns being correlated (i.e. adults and adultsandchildren). Perhaps resampling the data through K-fold cross validation may have been a better approach for such a data set, as it could have handled the bias-variance tradeoff better since it was tough to not overfit the data. It was interesting to observe the correlation between AIDS related deaths and orphans, as more deaths will naturally result in more orphans. Considering all the other external factors that play a role in this matter, such as access to the proper healthcare, is also very interesting, and a comprehensive data set with this kind of relevant information could yield some interesting results.
